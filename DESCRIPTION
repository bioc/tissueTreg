Description: The package provides ready to use epigenomes (obtained from TWGBS)
  and transcriptomes (RNA-seq) from various tissues as obtained in the study
  (Delacher and Imbusch 2017, PMID: 28783152).
  Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) perform two distinct functions: they maintain
  self-tolerance, and they support organ homeostasis by differentiating into
  specialized tissue Treg cells. The underlying dataset characterises the epigenetic
  and transcriptomic modifications for specialized tissue Treg cells.
